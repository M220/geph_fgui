# geph_fgui

\[WIP\]
Geph GUI rewritten in Flutter.

A hobby project of mine to learn more about Flutter, Dart, and Rust.

Currently in alpha, and uses a lot of mock data.

TODO:
- Implement tests
- Implement remaining days to actual last day conversion
- Geph VPN Service implementation (using the geph4-client binary/library)
- Hook up some GUI components like the Login, Registeration, Plus extension (Extend Button), News fetching (RSS), Server Fetching, and Status updates in the StatsRoute.
- Implement Excluded-Apps for Mobile devices
- Implement service stderr and stdout capture for Debug pack export and StatsRoute log output
- Hook up the settings components to their actual arguments when we call the geph4-client service binary or library.
